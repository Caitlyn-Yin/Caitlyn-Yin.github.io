Hi! I am a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics and Mathematics, minoring in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests lie broadly in Theoretical Machine Learning, e.g., Reinforcement Learning Theory and Deep Learning Theory.

I was professionally trained Go players. And in my free time, I enjoy playing Go (围棋), Guzheng（古筝） and the piano.
