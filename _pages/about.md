Hi! I am a first-year PhD student majoring in Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My research interests lie broadly in Deep Learning Theory and Statistical Learning.

I was professionally trained Go player. And in my free time, I enjoy playing Go (Weiqi), Chinese Zither (Guzheng) and the piano.
