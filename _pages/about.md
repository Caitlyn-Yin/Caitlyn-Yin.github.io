Hi! I am a senior-year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics and Mathematics, minoring in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests lie broadly in Deep Learning Theory and Statistical inference, Bioinformatics analysis.

I was professionally trained Go player. And in my free time, I enjoy playing Go (Weiqi), Chinese Zither (Guzheng) and the piano.
